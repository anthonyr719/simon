##Title: 
#Simon

##Description: 
#Simon is a colored pattern memory game. The 4 lights of the game light up in a sequence that the user will follow. If the user misses a color of the pattern sequence,or guesses a wrong color in the sequence, the user loses the game.

##Technologies used: 
#HTML / CSS/ Javascript 

##Planning: 
#For this game layout no wire frame or planning was necessary, Simon only has 4 different colored squares that represents the gameplay area, and a Start button. Simple layout is what I was going for.

##Development Journal: 
#The main brain of this gameplay would be to make the button light up and for the random colors to light up and create a new array of colors for the running pattern. I started the first day with the CSS & HTML. Then got the random function and light up for the buttons to work on day 2 & 3. Then I ran into a bug that would not double blink on multiple colored patterns. I played around with timing and got the game to work.


##Remaining issues or bugs that need fixing:
#I would still like to tweak the button functions a little bit. But for now the game is working and it is fun. Maybe also add a little more style to the buttons and interface.

##Features to add / wishlist: 
#I would like to add a score keep so that more people can play and keep track of what level theyâ€™ve reached in the game.
